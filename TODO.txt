TODO
- add select/unselect all button to the route selection
- maintain stop name in settings so that stop name is displayed in settings instead of number
- add loading of routes when entering routes selection if no routes available (i.e. routes download was cancelled)
- maintain rectangle for loaded stops on map so it only loads stops if you move outside said rectangle
- fix repainting issue on the map
- add address/stopnumber search to mapview
- when a stop is already selected, zoom in to that stop as starting area for map


- change from 2 journeys (home and work) to multiple journeys, allow selection of "Default for: AM / PM / Blank"


- add updating service to download data periodically
- clean out unnecessary data after loading data
